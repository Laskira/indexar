I \nwould appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined \nbelow:\n\nIMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business \nunit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, \nwould like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June \n8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to \nvisit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of \nus to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please \ncontact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.\nNew building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  \nAny change requests that have already been received are currently being \nconsidered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.\nIf vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August \n3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their \nname, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH \n7/25\nAny space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed \nby Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related \nissues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for \nthe allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well \ninformed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.\nJeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we \nwill be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near \nfuture.\nA limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The \nTurret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  \nEveryone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent \nphone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if \nyou have any questions or issues related to phones.\nAll private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and \nthere are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or \npeople.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space \navailable by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow \nlater):\n1 Mega conference room\n1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities\n1 Large conference room - no videoconference \n3 Team rooms\nFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will \nbe made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned \nfile space as close to each individual group as possible.\nAt this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not \nbeen resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues \nwill be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new \nbuilding will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move \ndate, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries \nand distribution.\nSince Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would \nappreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to \nthem via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday \nat 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make \narrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.\nThere will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the \nnew building.\n\nI understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of \nquestions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great \nand everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and \nassistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as \npossible.\n\nMike","database._sent_mail.7":"Message-ID: \u003c21697434.1075843977314.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 02:50:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nTo: peggy.mccurley@enron.com\r\nSubject: Re: Thank you for Chicago\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Mike McConnell\r\nX-To: Peggy McCurley\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nPeggy, I'm glad you had a good time.

(i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so \nits possible, (but i didnt for the second)).\n\none unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with \nsome of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them \nfrom doing business with us.\n\nanother primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to \nenron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was \nsomewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get \nthem to transact with us.\n\nanother unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact \nthat forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few \nmillion in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common \nwisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand \nwould decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as \never and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher \nmargins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.\n\nwe also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient \nportfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the \nbusiness too quickly from this position.\n\nof course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out \ndifferently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to \nhedge out our book in a difficult environment.\n\nfirst, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain \nreinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, \nwhich will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in \nfinal negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final \nportfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have \nseen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with \n$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = \n$30 million).\n\nsecond, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a \"high gamma\" risk going \ninto june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but \nif it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying \ncommodity to gain time for placing the insurance.\nthis should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on \nsignificant risk.\n  \nthis may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  \nwhen backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come \nup with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past \n2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized \nhedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the \nidea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently \ncalling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma \nhedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, \nyou can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic \nhedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the \nblack-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the \nunderlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on \nthe system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next \noutage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail \nrisk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other \nbenefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory \nused by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire \nnew way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like \nB-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of \nour problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in \npower trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory \nto the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively \nmanage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less \nthan $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.\n\nwe can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince \u0026 \nvasant to get their thoughts.\n\n","database.all_documents.144":"Message-ID: \u003c6977149.1075843902571.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Tue, 22 May 2001 03:55:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: joseph.hirl@enron.com\r\nTo: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nSubject: Sato\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Joseph P Hirl\r\nX-To: Mike McConnell\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nNI was quite proud that they showed good results for last year.

This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the \npart I have highlighted.\n\nGeneral reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to \nhave worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the \nproject becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.\n\nAt the same time, we have just received the official notification from the \nSaudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as \"fierce \ncompetition\", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy \nand will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships \nthat we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time \nthat we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for \nDabhol) does not help.\n\nAs you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud \nof the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished \nthe impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, \nSADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system \nfor Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited \nredeployment potential and little PRC support because of the \"ex EI\" stigma.\n\nOver the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press \nannouncements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), \nexplanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., \nU.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai \ngovernment wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I \nsuspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events \nunfold).  \n\nIn addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the \nDubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.\n\nThe next several days are not going to be fun....\n\nRick\n---------------------- Forwarded by Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n05/19/2001 10:15 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeffrey Hammad\n05/18/2001 05:21 AM\nTo: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Maurizio La \nNoce/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob \nStewart/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kevin \nRuffcorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pete Cleary@Enron, Daniella \nCarneiro@ENRON\ncc: Jackie Gentle@ECT, Mac McClelland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Article: Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\nFirms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n05/17/2001\nThe Oil Daily\n(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.\n\nIt's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in\nthe Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8\nbillion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE).\n\nAt the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of\nZakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from\nthe offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal\nDutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at\nthe beginning of next year.\nHaving been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal\nfrom Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the\nmandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE\nOffsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press\nconference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.\n\nEnron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh\nMohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure\nin the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will\nthen sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total,\nwhich will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its\n24.5% interest.\n\nWho else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no\nshortage of interested parties.\n\n\"The whole industry wants to get involved,\" a source close to the project\nsaid.\n\nAmong the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which\nwould compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d\nDubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which\nlike Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then\nthere are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are\ninterested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for\nmore than 20 years.\n\n\"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,\" said one analyst in the\nregion. \"There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is\nreliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the\ncourse of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line\nof thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players\nmay have more to gain and thus more to offer.\n\nThe Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is\npart of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron\nseemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to\nsell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to\nselling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had\nmade several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that\nwere never fulfilled.\n\nIronically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks\ncertain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial \"term sheet\"\nfor the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the\nproduction of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North\nfield. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn.

EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... \nfor all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will \nrun Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  \nAccordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel \nin the London office. \n\nI anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins \nin the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and \naddressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to \nTodd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn \nagain in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We \nhave hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of \nour activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian \nHudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the \ninfrastructure necessary to trade weather.\n\nIn addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine \nWoolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in \nLondon to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one \nindividual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.\n\nPaul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within \nEurope and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals \nin the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and \na direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and \naccountability.\n\nWith respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as \ncompletely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their \nactivities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will \nshare infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks \nwithin Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a \nScandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather \ngroup.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather \npositions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.\n\nPaul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into \nconsideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain \nresponsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien."}

I \nwould appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined \nbelow:\n\nIMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business \nunit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, \nwould like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June \n8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to \nvisit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of \nus to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please \ncontact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.\nNew building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  \nAny change requests that have already been received are currently being \nconsidered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.\nIf vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August \n3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their \nname, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH \n7/25\nAny space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed \nby Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related \nissues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for \nthe allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well \ninformed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.\nJeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we \nwill be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near \nfuture.\nA limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The \nTurret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  \nEveryone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent \nphone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if \nyou have any questions or issues related to phones.\nAll private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and \nthere are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or \npeople.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space \navailable by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow \nlater):\n1 Mega conference room\n1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities\n1 Large conference room - no videoconference \n3 Team rooms\nFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will \nbe made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned \nfile space as close to each individual group as possible.\nAt this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not \nbeen resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues \nwill be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new \nbuilding will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move \ndate, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries \nand distribution.\nSince Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would \nappreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to \nthem via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday \nat 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make \narrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.\nThere will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the \nnew building.\n\nI understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of \nquestions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great \nand everything will work out in time.

I hope all is well.\n\nI want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch \nwith Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great \nstrides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. \nHowever, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most \nlikely going to be sold off in pieces.\n\nI have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility \nof an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion \nthat EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be \nright for me to consider an origination position with EBS.\n\nWith that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what \nopportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an \norigination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally \ntough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience \nin professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial \nskills.\n\nMike please consider the attached resume below.

(i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so \nits possible, (but i didnt for the second)).\n\none unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with \nsome of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them \nfrom doing business with us.\n\nanother primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to \nenron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was \nsomewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get \nthem to transact with us.\n\nanother unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact \nthat forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few \nmillion in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common \nwisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand \nwould decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as \never and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher \nmargins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.\n\nwe also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient \nportfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the \nbusiness too quickly from this position.\n\nof course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out \ndifferently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to \nhedge out our book in a difficult environment.\n\nfirst, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain \nreinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, \nwhich will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in \nfinal negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final \nportfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have \nseen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with \n$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = \n$30 million).\n\nsecond, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a \"high gamma\" risk going \ninto june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but \nif it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying \ncommodity to gain time for placing the insurance.\nthis should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on \nsignificant risk.\n  \nthis may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  \nwhen backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come \nup with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past \n2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized \nhedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the \nidea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently \ncalling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma \nhedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, \nyou can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic \nhedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the \nblack-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the \nunderlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on \nthe system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next \noutage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail \nrisk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other \nbenefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory \nused by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire \nnew way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like \nB-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of \nour problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in \npower trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory \nto the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively \nmanage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less \nthan $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.\n\nwe can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince \u0026 \nvasant to get their thoughts.\n\n","database.all_documents.144":"Message-ID: \u003c6977149.1075843902571.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Tue, 22 May 2001 03:55:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: joseph.hirl@enron.com\r\nTo: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nSubject: Sato\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Joseph P Hirl\r\nX-To: Mike McConnell\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nNI was quite proud that they showed good results for last year.

Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press\nconference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.\n\nEnron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh\nMohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure\nin the Abu Dhabi ruling family.

Total,\nwhich will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its\n24.5% interest.\n\nWho else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no\nshortage of interested parties.\n\n\"The whole industry wants to get involved,\" a source close to the project\nsaid.\n\nAmong the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which\nwould compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d\nDubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which\nlike Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then\nthere are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are\ninterested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for\nmore than 20 years.\n\n\"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,\" said one analyst in the\nregion. \"There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is\nreliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the\ncourse of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line\nof thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players\nmay have more to gain and thus more to offer.\n\nThe Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is\npart of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron\nseemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to\nsell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to\nselling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had\nmade several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that\nwere never fulfilled.\n\nIronically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks\ncertain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial \"term sheet\"\nfor the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the\nproduction of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North\nfield. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to\ndeliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is\n88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co.\nZadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP\nand 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme\nPetroleum Council decided against the idea.\n\nPaul Sampson.\n\n(c) Copyright 2001.

EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... \nfor all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will \nrun Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  \nAccordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel \nin the London office. \n\nI anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins \nin the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and \naddressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to \nTodd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn \nagain in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We \nhave hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of \nour activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian \nHudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the \ninfrastructure necessary to trade weather.\n\nIn addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine \nWoolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in \nLondon to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one \nindividual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.\n\nPaul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within \nEurope and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals \nin the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and \na direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and \naccountability.\n\nWith respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as \ncompletely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their \nactivities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will \nshare infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks \nwithin Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a \nScandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather \ngroup.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather \npositions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.\n\nPaul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into \nconsideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain \nresponsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien."}

I \nwould appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined \nbelow:\n\nIMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business \nunit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, \nwould like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June \n8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to \nvisit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of \nus to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please \ncontact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.\nNew building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  \nAny change requests that have already been received are currently being \nconsidered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.\nIf vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August \n3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their \nname, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH \n7/25\nAny space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed \nby Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related \nissues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for \nthe allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well \ninformed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.\nJeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we \nwill be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near \nfuture.\nA limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The \nTurret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  \nEveryone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent \nphone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if \nyou have any questions or issues related to phones.\nAll private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and \nthere are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or \npeople.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space \navailable by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow \nlater):\n1 Mega conference room\n1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities\n1 Large conference room - no videoconference \n3 Team rooms\nFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will \nbe made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned \nfile space as close to each individual group as possible.\nAt this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not \nbeen resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues \nwill be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new \nbuilding will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move \ndate, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries \nand distribution.\nSince Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would \nappreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to \nthem via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday \nat 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make \narrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.\nThere will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the \nnew building.\n\nI understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of \nquestions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great \nand everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and \nassistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as \npossible.\n\nMike","database._sent_mail.7":"Message-ID: \u003c21697434.1075843977314.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 02:50:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nTo: peggy.mccurley@enron.com\r\nSubject: Re: Thank you for Chicago\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Mike McConnell\r\nX-To: Peggy McCurley\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nPeggy, I'm glad you had a good time.

I hope all is well.\n\nI want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch \nwith Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great \nstrides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. \nHowever, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most \nlikely going to be sold off in pieces.\n\nI have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility \nof an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion \nthat EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be \nright for me to consider an origination position with EBS.\n\nWith that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what \nopportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an \norigination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally \ntough and fearless of contacting potential clients.

(i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so \nits possible, (but i didnt for the second)).\n\none unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with \nsome of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them \nfrom doing business with us.\n\nanother primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to \nenron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was \nsomewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get \nthem to transact with us.\n\nanother unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact \nthat forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few \nmillion in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common \nwisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand \nwould decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as \never and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher \nmargins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.\n\nwe also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient \nportfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the \nbusiness too quickly from this position.\n\nof course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out \ndifferently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to \nhedge out our book in a difficult environment.\n\nfirst, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain \nreinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, \nwhich will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in \nfinal negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final \nportfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have \nseen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with \n$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = \n$30 million).\n\nsecond, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a \"high gamma\" risk going \ninto june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but \nif it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying \ncommodity to gain time for placing the insurance.\nthis should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on \nsignificant risk.\n  \nthis may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  \nwhen backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come \nup with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past \n2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized \nhedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the \nidea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently \ncalling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma \nhedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, \nyou can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic \nhedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the \nblack-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the \nunderlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on \nthe system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next \noutage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail \nrisk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other \nbenefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory \nused by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire \nnew way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like \nB-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of \nour problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in \npower trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory \nto the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively \nmanage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less \nthan $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.\n\nwe can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince \u0026 \nvasant to get their thoughts.\n\n","database.all_documents.144":"Message-ID: \u003c6977149.1075843902571.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Tue, 22 May 2001 03:55:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: joseph.hirl@enron.com\r\nTo: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nSubject: Sato\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Joseph P Hirl\r\nX-To: Mike McConnell\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nNI was quite proud that they showed good results for last year.

We have already wired this with Oxy \nand will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships \nthat we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time \nthat we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for \nDabhol) does not help.\n\nAs you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud \nof the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished \nthe impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, \nSADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system \nfor Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited \nredeployment potential and little PRC support because of the \"ex EI\" stigma.\n\nOver the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press \nannouncements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), \nexplanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., \nU.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai \ngovernment wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I \nsuspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events \nunfold).  \n\nIn addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the \nDubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.\n\nThe next several days are not going to be fun....\n\nRick\n---------------------- Forwarded by Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n05/19/2001 10:15 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeffrey Hammad\n05/18/2001 05:21 AM\nTo: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Maurizio La \nNoce/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob \nStewart/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kevin \nRuffcorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pete Cleary@Enron, Daniella \nCarneiro@ENRON\ncc: Jackie Gentle@ECT, Mac McClelland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Article: Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\nFirms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n05/17/2001\nThe Oil Daily\n(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.\n\nIt's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in\nthe Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8\nbillion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE).\n\nAt the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of\nZakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from\nthe offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal\nDutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at\nthe beginning of next year.\nHaving been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal\nfrom Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the\nmandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE\nOffsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press\nconference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.\n\nEnron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh\nMohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure\nin the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will\nthen sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total,\nwhich will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its\n24.5% interest.\n\nWho else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no\nshortage of interested parties.\n\n\"The whole industry wants to get involved,\" a source close to the project\nsaid.\n\nAmong the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which\nwould compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d\nDubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which\nlike Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then\nthere are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are\ninterested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for\nmore than 20 years.\n\n\"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,\" said one analyst in the\nregion. \"There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is\nreliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the\ncourse of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line\nof thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players\nmay have more to gain and thus more to offer.\n\nThe Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is\npart of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron\nseemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to\nsell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to\nselling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had\nmade several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that\nwere never fulfilled.\n\nIronically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks\ncertain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial \"term sheet\"\nfor the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the\nproduction of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North\nfield. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to\ndeliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is\n88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co.\nZadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP\nand 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme\nPetroleum Council decided against the idea.\n\nPaul Sampson.\n\n(c) Copyright 2001.

EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... \nfor all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will \nrun Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  \nAccordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel \nin the London office. \n\nI anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins \nin the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and \naddressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to \nTodd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn \nagain in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We \nhave hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of \nour activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian \nHudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the \ninfrastructure necessary to trade weather.\n\nIn addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine \nWoolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in \nLondon to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one \nindividual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.\n\nPaul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within \nEurope and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals \nin the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and \na direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and \naccountability.\n\nWith respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as \ncompletely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their \nactivities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will \nshare infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks \nwithin Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a \nScandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather \ngroup.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather \npositions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.\n\nPaul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into \nconsideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain \nresponsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien."}

I \nwould appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined \nbelow:\n\nIMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business \nunit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, \nwould like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June \n8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to \nvisit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of \nus to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please \ncontact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.\nNew building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  \nAny change requests that have already been received are currently being \nconsidered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.\nIf vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August \n3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their \nname, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH \n7/25\nAny space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed \nby Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related \nissues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for \nthe allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well \ninformed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.\nJeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we \nwill be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near \nfuture.\nA limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The \nTurret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  \nEveryone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent \nphone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if \nyou have any questions or issues related to phones.\nAll private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and \nthere are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or \npeople.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space \navailable by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow \nlater):\n1 Mega conference room\n1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities\n1 Large conference room - no videoconference \n3 Team rooms\nFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will \nbe made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned \nfile space as close to each individual group as possible.\nAt this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not \nbeen resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues \nwill be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new \nbuilding will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move \ndate, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries \nand distribution.\nSince Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would \nappreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to \nthem via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday \nat 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make \narrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.\nThere will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the \nnew building.\n\nI understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of \nquestions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great \nand everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and \nassistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as \npossible.\n\nMike","database._sent_mail.7":"Message-ID: \u003c21697434.1075843977314.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 02:50:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nTo: peggy.mccurley@enron.com\r\nSubject: Re: Thank you for Chicago\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Mike McConnell\r\nX-To: Peggy McCurley\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nPeggy, I'm glad you had a good time.

(i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so \nits possible, (but i didnt for the second)).\n\none unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with \nsome of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them \nfrom doing business with us.\n\nanother primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to \nenron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was \nsomewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get \nthem to transact with us.\n\nanother unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact \nthat forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few \nmillion in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common \nwisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand \nwould decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as \never and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher \nmargins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.\n\nwe also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient \nportfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the \nbusiness too quickly from this position.\n\nof course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out \ndifferently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to \nhedge out our book in a difficult environment.\n\nfirst, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain \nreinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, \nwhich will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in \nfinal negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final \nportfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have \nseen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with \n$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = \n$30 million).\n\nsecond, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a \"high gamma\" risk going \ninto june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but \nif it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying \ncommodity to gain time for placing the insurance.\nthis should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on \nsignificant risk.\n  \nthis may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  \nwhen backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come \nup with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past \n2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized \nhedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the \nidea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently \ncalling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma \nhedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, \nyou can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic \nhedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the \nblack-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the \nunderlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on \nthe system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next \noutage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail \nrisk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other \nbenefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory \nused by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire \nnew way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like \nB-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of \nour problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in \npower trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory \nto the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively \nmanage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less \nthan $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.\n\nwe can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince \u0026 \nvasant to get their thoughts.\n\n","database.all_documents.144":"Message-ID: \u003c6977149.1075843902571.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e\r\nDate: Tue, 22 May 2001 03:55:00 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: joseph.hirl@enron.com\r\nTo: mike.mcconnell@enron.com\r\nSubject: Sato\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-From: Joseph P Hirl\r\nX-To: Mike McConnell\r\nX-cc: \r\nX-bcc: \r\nX-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\r\nX-Origin: MCCONNELL-M\r\nX-FileName: mmcconn.nsf\r\n\r\nNI was quite proud that they showed good results for last year.

This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the \npart I have highlighted.\n\nGeneral reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to \nhave worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the \nproject becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.\n\nAt the same time, we have just received the official notification from the \nSaudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as \"fierce \ncompetition\", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy \nand will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships \nthat we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time \nthat we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for \nDabhol) does not help.\n\nAs you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud \nof the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished \nthe impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, \nSADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system \nfor Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited \nredeployment potential and little PRC support because of the \"ex EI\" stigma.\n\nOver the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press \nannouncements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), \nexplanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., \nU.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai \ngovernment wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I \nsuspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events \nunfold).  \n\nIn addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the \nDubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.\n\nThe next several days are not going to be fun....\n\nRick\n---------------------- Forwarded by Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n05/19/2001 10:15 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeffrey Hammad\n05/18/2001 05:21 AM\nTo: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Maurizio La \nNoce/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob \nStewart/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kevin \nRuffcorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pete Cleary@Enron, Daniella \nCarneiro@ENRON\ncc: Jackie Gentle@ECT, Mac McClelland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Article: Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\n\n\nFirms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.\n\n05/17/2001\nThe Oil Daily\n(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.\n\nIt's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in\nthe Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8\nbillion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE).\n\nAt the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of\nZakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from\nthe offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal\nDutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at\nthe beginning of next year.\nHaving been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal\nfrom Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the\nmandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE\nOffsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press\nconference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.\n\nEnron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh\nMohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure\nin the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will\nthen sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total,\nwhich will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its\n24.5% interest.\n\nWho else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no\nshortage of interested parties.\n\n\"The whole industry wants to get involved,\" a source close to the project\nsaid.\n\nAmong the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which\nwould compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d\nDubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which\nlike Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then\nthere are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are\ninterested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for\nmore than 20 years.\n\n\"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,\" said one analyst in the\nregion. \"There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is\nreliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the\ncourse of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line\nof thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players\nmay have more to gain and thus more to offer.\n\nThe Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is\npart of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron\nseemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to\nsell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to\nselling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had\nmade several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that\nwere never fulfilled.\n\nIronically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks\ncertain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial \"term sheet\"\nfor the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the\nproduction of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North\nfield. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to\ndeliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is\n88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co.\nZadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP\nand 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme\nPetroleum Council decided against the idea.\n\nPaul Sampson.\n\n(c) Copyright 2001.

I will \nrun Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  \nAccordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel \nin the London office. \n\nI anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins \nin the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and \naddressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to \nTodd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn \nagain in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We \nhave hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of \nour activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian \nHudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the \ninfrastructure necessary to trade weather.\n\nIn addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine \nWoolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in \nLondon to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one \nindividual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.\n\nPaul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within \nEurope and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals \nin the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and \na direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and \naccountability.\n\nWith respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as \ncompletely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their \nactivities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will \nshare infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks \nwithin Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a \nScandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather \ngroup.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather \npositions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.\n\nPaul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into \nconsideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain \nresponsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien."}
